# Unsplash Clone

This project is a mini clone of the Unsplash website, built using Vue.js, Axios, and SCSS, which interacts with the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch and display photos. The app implements features such as a staggered grid layout, image modals, and loading placeholders, while focusing on responsive design and a smooth user experience.

## Features

- **Landing Page**: Displays 7-8 latest "African" photos fetched from the Unsplash API.
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for photos, showing results in a staggered grid.
- **Image Modal**: Clicking on an image opens a modal displaying the image in the highest resolution.
- **Loading Placeholders**: Show placeholders while images are being fetched from the API.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to various screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Vue.js**: JavaScript framework for building the app's user interface.
- **Axios**: Used for making API calls to the Unsplash API.
- **SCSS**: SASS syntax used to style the app, ensuring maintainable and modular styles.
